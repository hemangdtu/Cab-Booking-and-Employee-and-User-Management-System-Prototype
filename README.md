The program has been assigned a name – ‘LOCO’ and has a user friendly interface which will help the user in booking a cab in the city of Delhi or Mumbai as per his preference. It is interesting to note that the programming has been done in such a way that new cities can be added into the system very easily as per one’s requirement. Also modular programming has been extensively used to increase the readability and understandability of the program. It is important to highlight the fact that special emphasis has been given to the concept of data security in this program.
